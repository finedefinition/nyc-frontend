# Norse Yacht Co.

This is a collaborative educational project where we are developing a marketplace for yachts from Norway. The project includes a separate backend system and involves a team consisting of developers, a designer, and a tester. Our goal is to learn and apply various skills while creating a functional and user-friendly platform for yacht buyers and sellers.

The front-end of the project is built using Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Ant Design, and integrates images from AWS S3, while maintaining code quality with Prettier, ESLint, and Husky.
